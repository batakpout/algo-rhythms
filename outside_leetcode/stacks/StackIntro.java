/* LIFO
 underflow happens when peek or pop called on empty stack
 overflow happens when push called on full stack. [hardly happens because of dynamic sized collection under the hood or linked list]
 Some real world applications:
 1. Function calls
 2. balanced parenthesis by compilers
 3. Reversing items
 4. Infix to Postfix/Prefix
 5. Evaluation of Postfix/Prefix
 6. Stock span problem and its variants
 7. undo/redo or forward/backward in editor and browser.
